    "> \n",
    "> The official builds are great, but you'll have to install all the packages yourself. Also, if it is a Python that is built into your system, you could break things by changing your packages. For now, using the Anaconda build provides you with everything you need, is safe for your system, and some packages are easier to install. There are special cases outside of this class where you might not want Anaconda Python, so talk to me if you think that might be the case."
